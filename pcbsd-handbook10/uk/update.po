msgid "Both PC-BSD® and TrueOS® provide tools to make it easy to manage software and to keep both the operating system and installed software up-to-date. PC-BSD® provides the graphical :ref:`AppCafe®` and :ref:`Update Manager` utilities for managing and upgrading software from the local system or from a web browser or mobile device. Since TrueOS® is a command-line only install and some users prefer to use command-line utilities, both PC-BSD® and TrueOS® provide the :command:`pkg` command line utility to manage software, as well as :command:`pc-updatemanager` to manage updates. If you install software using any of the tools described in this chapter, you will automatically be notified whenever a newer version of software is available."

A :wikipedia:`FreeBSD jail` provides a very light-weight, operating system-level virtualization. A jail is similar to running an independent instance of FreeBSD on the same hardware, without all of the overhead usually associated with virtualization. Jails are usually created for running applications or services. For example, you could host your own media server on your desktop system without affecting other installed applications or your data. Each jail has its own IP address, running processes, and users. Whatever happens in that jail does not affect your operating system or other jails running on the PC-BSD® system."

Note that :command:`warden` is still available in PC-BSD® to provide time for users to transition to using  :command:`iocage`. Documentation for using the command line version of :command:`warden` can be found in `this section of the 10.1.2 User Guide <http://download.pcbsd.org/iso/10.1-RELEASE/amd64/docs/html/controlpanel.html#using-the-command-line-version-of-warden>`_."

Should a power failure occur in the middle of an update, the system will reboot into the current boot environment, returning the system to the point before the upgrade started.
