msgid "Beginning with |version|, the PC-BSD® installer installs the Lumina Desktop Environment (Lumina for short). Additional window managers can be installed using :ref:`AppCafe®`. This chapter describes the Lumina Configuration utility and the various utilities which are built into Lumina.

msgid "Lumina is a lightweight, XDG-compliant, BSD-licensed desktop environment that focuses specifically on streamlining the ability to get work done while minimizing system overhead. It is specifically designed for PC-BSD® and FreeBSD, but has also been ported to many other BSD and Linux operating systems. It is based on the Qt graphical toolkit and the Fluxbox window manager, and uses a small number of X utilities for various tasks, such as :command:`numlockx` and :command:`xscreensaver`."
