msgid "**Pool:** a collection of devices that provides physical storage and data replication managed by ZFS. This pooled storage model eliminates the concept of volumes and the associated problems of partitions, provisioning, wasted bandwidth, and stranded storage. Thousands of filesystems can draw from a common storage pool, each one consuming only as much space as it actually needs. The combined I/O bandwidth of all devices in the pool is available to all filesystems at all times. The `Storage Pools Recommendations <http://www.solarisinternals.com/wiki/index.php/ZFS_Best_Practices_Guide#ZFS_Storage_Pools_Recommendations>`_ of the ZFS Best Practices Guide provides detailed recommendations for creating the storage pool."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Mirror:** a form of RAID where all data is mirrored onto two or more disks, creating a redundant copy should a disk fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:293
msgid "**RAIDZ:** ZFS software solution that is equivalent to RAID5 in that it allows one disk to fail without losing data. Requires a minimum of 3 disks."

#: ../../install.rst:295
msgid "**RAIDZ2:** double-parity ZFS software solution that is similar to RAID6 in that it allows two disks to fail without losing data. Requires a minimum of 4 disks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:298
msgid "**RAIDZ3:** triple-parity ZFS software solution. RAIDZ3 offers three parity drives and can operate in degraded mode if up to three drives fail with no restrictions on which drives can fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:301
msgid "**Dataset:** once a pool is created, it can be divided into datasets. A dataset is similar to a folder in that it supports permissions. A dataset is also similar to a filesystem in that you can set properties such as quotas and compression."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:304
msgid "**Snapshot:** a read-only point-in-time copy of a filesystem. Snapshots can be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take up very little space. For example, a snapshot where no files have changed takes 0MB of storage, but if you change a 10GB file it will keep a copy of both the old and the new 10GB version. Snapshots provide a clever way of keeping a history of files, should you need to recover an older copy or even a deleted file. For this reason, many administrators take snapshots often (e.g. every 15 minutes), store them for a period of time (e.g. for a month), and store them on another system. Such a strategy allows the administrator to roll the system back to a specific time or, if there is a catastrophic loss, an off-site snapshot can restore the system up to the last snapshot interval (e.g. within 15 minutes of the data loss). Snapshots can be cloned or rolled back, but the files on the snapshot can not be accessed independently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:312
msgid "**Clone:** a writable copy of a snapshot which can only be created on the same ZFS volume. Clones provide an extremely space-efficient way to store many copies of mostly-shared data such as workspaces, software installations, and diskless clients. Clones do not inherit the properties of the parent dataset, but rather inherit the properties based on where the clone is created in the ZFS pool. Because a clone initially shares all its disk space with the original snapshot, its used property is initially zero. As changes are made to the clone, it uses more space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:317
msgid "**ZIL:** is effectively a filesystem journal that manages writes. The ZIL is a temporary storage area for sync writes until they are written asynchronously to the ZFS pool. If the system has many sync writes, such as from a database server, performance can be increased by adding a dedicated log device known as a SLOG (Secondary LOG). If the system has few sync writes, a SLOG will not speed up writes. When creating a dedicated log device, it is recommended to use a fast SSD with a supercapacitor or a bank of capacitors that can handle writing the contents of the SSD's RAM to the SSD. If you decide to create a dedicated log device, the SSD should be half the size of system RAM as anything larger than that is unused capacity. Note that a dedicated log device can not be shared between ZFS pools and that the same device cannot hold both a log and a cache device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:324
msgid "**L2ARC:** ZFS uses a RAM cache to reduce read latency. If an SSD is dedicated as a cache device, it is known as an L2ARC and ZFS uses it to store more reads which can increase random read performance. However, adding a cache device will not improve a system with too little RAM and will actually decrease performance as ZFS uses RAM to track the contents of L2ARC. RAM is always faster than disks, so always add as much RAM as possible before determining if the system would benefit from a L2ARC device. If you have a lot of applications that do large amounts of random reads on a dataset small enough to fit into the L2ARC, read performance may be increased by adding a dedicated cache device. SSD cache devices only help if your working set is larger than system RAM, but small enough that a significant percentage of it will fit on the SSD. Note that a dedicated L2ARC device can not be shared between ZFS pools."
