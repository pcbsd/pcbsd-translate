However, it has several advantages over a full backup. Snapshots occur instantaneously, meaning that the filesystem does not need to be unmounted and you can continue to use applications on your system as the snapshot is created. Since snapshots contain the meta-data ZFS uses to access files, the snapshots themselves are small and subsequent snapshots only contain the changes that occurred since the last snapshot was taken. This space efficiency means that you can take snapshots often. Snapshots also provide a convenient way to access previous versions of files as you can simply browse to the point-in-time for the version of the file that you need. Life Preserver makes it easy to configure when snapshots are taken and provides a built-in graphical browser for finding and restoring the files within a snapshot."

Life Preserver provides an alternate replication method which provides an extra measure of security by adding support for fully-encrypted backups using `stunnel <https://www.stunnel.org/index.html>`_ and GELI-backed iSCSI volumes. This means that the data stored on the remote side is encrypted and only accessible with the key file stored on the PC-BSD® system. The remote backup server must understand kernel iSCSI, meaning that it must be running FreeBSD, PC-BSD®/TrueOS®, or FreeNAS®. However, the remote system does not need to be formatted with ZFS."
