msgid "Both PC-BSD® and TrueOS® provide tools to make it easy to manage software and to keep both the operating system and installed software up-to-date. PC-BSD® provides the graphical :ref:`AppCafe®` and :ref:`Update Manager` utilities for managing and upgrading software from the local system or from a web browser or mobile device. Since TrueOS® is a command-line only install and some users prefer to use command-line utilities, both PC-BSD® and TrueOS® provide the :command:`pkg` command line utility to manage software, as well as :command:`pc-updatemanager` to manage updates. If you install software using any of the tools described in this chapter, you will automatically be notified whenever a newer version of software is available."
