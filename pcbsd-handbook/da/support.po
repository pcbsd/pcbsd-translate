For instance, to configure keyboard shortcuts that browse the \"File\" menu, put *&File* in the text slot for the menu entry when making the application. Whichever letter has the *&* symbol in front of it will become the hot key. You can also make a shortcut key by clicking the menu or submenu entry and assigning a shortcut key. Be careful not to duplicate hot keys or shortcut keys. Every key in a menu and submenu should have a key assigned for ease of use and accessibility. Tables 11.3b and 11.3c summarize the commonly used shortcut and hot keys."

Use \"PCBSD\" for the organization for applications that run with user permissions and \"PCBSD-root\" for applications that are started with root permissions via :command:`sudo`. Proper use prevents the directory where settings files are saved from being locked down by *root* applications, allowing user applications to save and load their settings. Examples 11.3a and 11.3b demonstrate how to use the QSettings class for each type of permission."
